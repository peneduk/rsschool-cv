About Myself
---
*Hey everybody who's reading this right now. I have 8 years experience as a manager in a large alcoholic beverage company. Originally from Odessa Ukraine, now I am in Katowice Poland and decided to change my field radically, choosing the path of a frontend developer. I have strong communication skills, ability to achieve goals and work in a team. I am ready to learn hard, master new technologies and apply knowledge in practice.*
